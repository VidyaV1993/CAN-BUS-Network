# CAN-BUS-Network
 CAN-BUS-Network programming using different microcontrollers

This project can be considered as a starter in CAN network development and automotive domain. This is a simple demonstration of CAN BUS network development using the following:
- ARM Cortex M3 based microcontroller and CAN transceivers (mbed LPC1768 boards along with MCP2551 CAN transceivers as the transmitter and receiver ECUs). 
- Arduino and CAN BUS Shield (Arduinos act as transmitter and receiver ECUs)
