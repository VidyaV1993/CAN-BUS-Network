This project is a demonstration of a simple CAN BUS network using Arduino and CAN BUS Shield. Two CAN BUS Shields are connected on top of an Arduino Uno and  an Arduino Mega respectively. CAN messages are sent from one end to control the circuit or display the values on the other end. This simple circuit is a beginner level project on CAN BUS communication.
