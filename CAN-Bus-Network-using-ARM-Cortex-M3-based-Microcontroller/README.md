This is a simple demonstration of CAN network development using ARM Cortex M3 based microcontroller and CAN transceivers. I have used mbed LPC1768 boards along with MCP2551 CAN transceivers as the transmitter and receiver ECUs. Programming is done using the mbed online compiler. This project can be considered as a starter in CAN network development and automotive domain.
